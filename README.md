**Efficiently run git commands across multiple repositories in parallel**

**Before:**
```bash
cd project1 && git pull && cd ..
cd project2 && git pull && cd ..
cd project3 && git pull && cd ..
# ... repeat for dozens of repositories
```

**After:**
```bash
gih pull  # Done! All repositories updated in parallel
```

It is just a tool to do this. It does nothing else.  
I created it because I was tired of managing dozens of microservice repositories for the projects I work on.

## Installation

### via Go Install (Recommended)

```bash
go install github.com/takecy/git-here/gih@latest
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
gih version
```

### via Binary Download

1. Download the latest binary from the [Release Page](https://github.com/takecy/git-here/releases) for your platform
2. Extract and place the binary in your `$PATH`
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x gih` (Unix-like systems)

**Supported Platforms:**
- Linux (amd64, arm64)
- macOS (amd64, arm64) 
- Windows (amd64, arm64)

## Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
gih [options] <git_command> [git_options]
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Pull all repositories in current directory
gih pull

# Check status of all repositories  
gih status

# Fetch from all remotes
gih fetch --all
```

## Examples

### Common Operations

**Update all repositories:**
```bash
gih pull
# Equivalent to running 'git pull' in each repository directory
```

**Check status across all repositories:**
```bash
gih status --short
# Shows git status for each repository in a compact format
```

**Fetch from all remotes:**
```bash
gih fetch --all --prune
# Fetches from all remotes and prunes deleted branches
```

### Advanced Filtering

**Target specific repositories with regex:**
```bash
# Only operate on repositories matching the pattern
gih --target "^(frontend|backend)" pull
# Only pulls repositories starting with 'frontend' or 'backend'

gih --target ".*-service$" status  
# Only checks status of repositories ending with '-service'
```

**Exclude repositories:**
```bash
# Ignore specific repositories
gih --ignore "^(test|temp)" pull
# Pulls all repositories except those starting with 'test' or 'temp'

gih --ignore ".*-wip$" status
# Check status of all repositories except those ending with '-wip'
```

**Combine target and ignore patterns:**
```bash
gih --target "^microservice" --ignore "deprecated" pull
# Pull only microservice repositories that aren't deprecated
```

### Performance Tuning

**Set custom timeout:**
```bash
# Increase timeout for slow operations
gih --timeout 60s pull
# Each repository operation will timeout after 60 seconds

gih --timeout 5m clone --recursive
# For operations that might take longer
```

**Control concurrency:**
```bash
# Limit concurrent operations (useful for resource-constrained environments)
gih -c 2 pull
# Only run 2 operations in parallel

# Maximize parallelism (default is number of CPU cores)  
gih -c 20 fetch
# Run up to 20 operations in parallel
```

### Real-World Scenarios

**Microservices maintenance:**
```bash
# Update all microservices before deployment
gih --target ".*-service$" pull

# Check which microservices have uncommitted changes
gih --target ".*-service$" status --porcelain
```

**Open source contribution workflow:**
```bash
# Fetch latest changes from all your forks
gih fetch upstream

# Check status of all your projects
gih status --short
```

**Monorepo-adjacent development:**
```bash
# Update all related projects in your workspace
gih --ignore "node_modules|\.venv" pull
```

### Directory Structure

git-here discovers repositories based on this structure:

```
workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .hidden-repo/     # ‚ùå Ignored (hidden directories starting with .)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-a/        # ‚úÖ Target (contains .git)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-b/        # ‚úÖ Target (contains .git)  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ non-git-dir/      # ‚ùå Ignored (no .git directory)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ some-file.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nested/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deep-repo/    # ‚ùå Not target (only scans direct subdirectories)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/
```

**Key Rules:**
- Only direct subdirectories are scanned (not deeply nested)
- Directories must contain a `.git` folder to be considered repositories
- Hidden directories (starting with `.`) are automatically ignored

## FAQ

### Q: Why doesn't git-here work with deeply nested repositories?
**A:** By design, git-here only scans direct subdirectories for performance and clarity. If you need to work with deeply nested repos, consider running git-here from different directory levels.

### Q: Can I use git-here with non-git commands?
**A:** No, git-here is specifically designed for git commands. It expects git repositories and uses git-specific logic.

### Q: How do I handle repositories that require different authentication?
**A:** git-here uses your existing git configuration and SSH keys. Ensure your git setup works normally first.

### Q: What happens if one repository fails?
**A:** Individual repository failures don't stop the entire operation. Failed repositories are reported, but git-here continues with the remaining repositories.

### Q: Can I use environment variables for configuration?
**A:** Currently, git-here uses command-line flags. Environment variable support may be added in future versions.

### Q: How do I update git-here?
**A:** Run `go install github.com/takecy/git-here/gih@latest` or download the latest binary from the releases page.
